# Architectural-recovery-SA
This is an architectural recovery of the [zeguu api project](https://github.com/zeeguu/api.git)
[zeguu web project](https://github.com/zeeguu/web)
[google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oe_TV7936Zmmzbbgq8rzqFpxYPX7SQHP#scrollTo=0ruTtX88Tb-w)



## Goal

- **Recover the architecture of an existing system**

- Document the outcome in an **individual report**
	- the target reader is a developer, who needs to take over that system and maintain it
	- brief (not more than 3 -- 5 pages)
	- do not explain to us what Symphony does in the report; you assume it's done
	- focus on your results




## Case-Study Systems

1. The Zeeguu Project 
	- [zeeguu.org](https://zeeguu.com) (invite code: zeeguu-preview)
	- Code:
		- Python Backend: [Zeeguu-API](https://github.com/zeeguu/API)
		- React Frontend: [Zeeguu-Web](https://github.com/zeeguu/web) 
	- A [paper](https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/CHI18-Paper/blob/master/!AsWeMayStudy--Preprint.pdf) about the system

or, 

2. Another system that you know
	- if it has comparable complexity (>200 files)
	- you confirm with me about the appropriateness of the system


## Viewpoints

1. Module Viewpoint (**default**)
	- we will write example code snippets in collab to support this
	- makes the most sense for the Zeeguu system

2. Other Viewpoints
	- you could look at the execution or deployment information
	- might make more sense for another system - the Zeeguu one is too simple (could be done together with the module)

## Tools 

- Are important for recovery

- **If you can program**, then this is your chance to be coding **analysis tools** over the upcoming lectures
	  - you can still code as a team! you only have to write the analysis on your own
	  - you don't have to use collab

- **If you can't program**, then you'll have to find third party tools (the time the programming ones spend on programming, you'll be spending on finding third party tools)
